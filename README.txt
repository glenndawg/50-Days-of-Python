These are the programs I wrote while working on my 50 Python challanges a day
All chalanges are from the book "50 Days of Python - A Challange a Day"
by Benjamin Bennett Alexander

All Questins uplaoded suffice for a result to the challanges, and include questions as to 
how I can improve on the code for further learning. 

I have also included some alternataive methods for solving the problems as to
understand the more efficient coding methods.
